# chsjui

Welcome to the CHSJUI repository!

CHSJUI is a compreensive set of Angular 2 components, directives, pipes and services we use internally at CHSJ (Centro Hospitalar São João) to develop jOne. jOne is a cutting edge EPR solution while we're transitioning to Angular 2 we decided to share our work with the comunity to help everyone jumpstart on Angular 2 with a great set of UI components. As we work through our transition we intend to add more controls with a special focus on the healthcare industry.

###Collaborations

We are open to all sorts of suggestions and feedback! Sharing code and ideas is how we'll all improve our platforms.
